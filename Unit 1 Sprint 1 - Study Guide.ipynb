There are a mix of written questions and coding exercises, both are equally important to prepare you for the sprint challenge as well as to be able to speak on these topics comfortably in interviews and on the job.\n","\n","If you get stuck or are unsure of something remember the 20 minute rule. If that doesn't help, then research a solution with google and stackoverflow. Only once you have exausted these methods should you turn to your track team and mentor - they won't be there on your SC or during an interview.
