At the beginning our data exploration is about understanding the characteristics of our dataset, but over time it becomes about communicating insights in as effective and digestable a manner as possible, and that typically means using graphs in one way or another.

        "Why am I **not** assigning a specific dataset to you for your assignment? As a baby step in getting you more comfortable with open-endedness. Traditional education has been training you to expect there to be a single correct solution to things -that's rarely the case in data science. There are pros and cons to every decision that we make. Over the course of the first unit, we will work on helping you be comfortable open-endedness as we navigate the sea of tradeoffs that exist when we approach data. and you choosing the dataset for your assignment is the first tiny step that we're going to take in that direction. \n",
