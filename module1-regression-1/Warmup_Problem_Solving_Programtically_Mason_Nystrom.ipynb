        "Failure is common, it is part of the process. Sometimes you will take on a problem you just don't grok. That is okay, work it honestly, try multiple solutions, and even if you end up with little to show for it you will likely have learned from it. Don't give up quickly but do step away if you get stuck, use the 20 minute rule because sometimes all you need is fresh eyes. If you do admit defeat, that's fine but don't stop there. Look at how other people solved the problem, understand each step of their process, look for how your approach differs. Knowing how you failed when someone else succeeded is overlooked as a teaching tool too often. Don't take the **L** and walk away, learn and get a rematch later on.\n",
