# Welcome to Lambda School Data Science - Unit 1!

## Sprint 1: Data Wrangling and Storytelling

In the repository, you will find the Guided Projects (lectures) and Module Projects (assignment) for each module.

### Import note about autograding

Lambda School has been working to improve the feedback process for student project submissions. We have implemented an automatic grading process for both Module Projects and Sprint Challenges. All of the Module Project (Assignment) notebooks in this Sprint are in an autograded format. You will download (or fork this repo) the Module Project notebooks, complete the tasks, and then upload your notebook to Canvas for the grading. There is more information about the autograding process in your Canvas cohort course for this Sprint.
